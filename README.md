## üéØ About This Project

Windows Event Threat Navigator (WETN) is a quick reference tool built to solve a common analyst problem: rapidly looking up Windows Security and Sysmon event IDs with immediate context about their security significance. Whether you're investigating an incident, building detection rules, or simply learning about Windows event logs, this tool provides fast access to event documentation with MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ mappings.

**This is an experimental reference tool**, not a production-ready security product. It serves as a helpful utility for speeding up the common analyst task of understanding Windows event context and potential security implications.

### Key Capabilities

- **470+ Events Documented** - Windows Security (441 events) and Sysmon (29 events)
- **MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Integration** - Manual mappings to adversary techniques and tactics
- **Enhanced Event Analysis** - In-depth security context for critical events
- **Key Log Fields** - 152 events with exact field names and analyst guidance
- **Fast Search & Filtering** - Instant lookup by Event ID, name, category, or MITRE technique

---

## Core Functionality ‚ö°

At its core, this tool provides a searchable interface to:

1. **Look up** Windows Security and Sysmon event IDs
2. View event **names, descriptions, and categories**
3. Access **MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ technique mappings** for threat context
4. Review **key log fields** that SOC/IR teams should focus on during analysis
5. Read **analyst notes** on common scenarios and investigation tips
6. Understand **security implications** and detection strategies
7. **Filter events** by source (Windows/Sysmon) and category

## Key Features üöÄ

### Event Coverage
- **Unified Event Data** - Comprehensive Windows Security and Sysmon event database
- **Enhanced Content** - Deep-dive analysis for critical security events with:
  - Quick answer summaries for rapid triage
  - Detailed explanations of event significance
  - Security implications and threat context
  - Detection strategies and baseline guidance
  - Real-world attack examples from documented campaigns
  - Related event correlations

### MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Integration
- **Manual Technique Mappings** - Events mapped to specific MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ techniques based on analyst research
- **Rich Context** - View Technique ID, Name, Tactics, and Descriptions
- **Investigation Starting Points** - Understand which adversary behaviors each event can detect
- **Important Disclaimer** - All mappings are potential associations; context is critical for accurate threat assessment

### Key Log Fields (152 Events)
- **Exact Technical Field Names** - Uses actual Windows Event Log field names (e.g., `SubjectUserName`, `LogonType`, `IpAddress`)
- **Detailed Descriptions** - Field explanations with examples, status codes, and analysis guidance
- **Coverage Areas** - Authentication, account management, process execution, network activity, policy changes, and more
- **SOC/IR Focus** - Highlights the most critical fields for security analysis and threat hunting

### Search & Filtering
- **Fast Client-Side Search** - Instant results across Event ID, Name, Category, MITRE ID/Name, and Notes
- **Source Filtering** - Switch between Windows Security, Sysmon, or all events
- **Multiple View Modes** - Card view, list view, and detailed event pages
- **Official Documentation Links** - Direct references to Microsoft documentation

## Data Sources & Mapping Process üìä

The tool integrates several data sources processed during build:

### 1. Base Event Data (`/src/data/*.json`)
- Contains Event ID, Source, Name, Description, and Official Link
- Derived primarily from Microsoft documentation for Security Events and Sysmon

### 2. Manual Mappings (`/src/data/mappings/*.ts`)
- **`categories.ts`** - Assigns categories (e.g., "Authentication", "Process Execution") to each Event ID
- **`scenarios.ts`** - Curated notes, common legitimate uses, and analysis considerations for specific events
- **`mitre.ts`** - **Manually maps Event IDs to MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Technique IDs** (e.g., "T1059", "T1110.003") based on analyst research
- **`keyFields.ts`** - Maps 152 events to critical log fields with exact technical names and detailed descriptions

### 3. Processed MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Data (`/src/data/mitre_processed/techniques.json`)
- **Source:** Generated offline using `process_stix.py` script that parses the official `enterprise-attack.json` STIX bundle from [mitre-attack/attack-stix-data](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-stix-data/)
- **Content:** Structured details (ID, Name, Description, Tactics, URL) for ATT&CK¬Æ techniques with cleaned descriptions

### 4. Merging Logic
- Next.js app loads all data sources at build time
- For each event, looks up Category, Scenarios, and Key Log Fields from mapping files
- Uses manual MITRE mapping to find relevant Technique IDs
- Retrieves full technique details from processed STIX data
- Merged `EventDetail` objects are passed to client-side components

## Important Disclaimers ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Experimental Nature
This is a side project and **NOT a production-ready security tool**. Use it as a reference aid only. Always verify information against official documentation and your own analysis.

### Data Accuracy
Event descriptions and mappings are based on public data and manual interpretation. They may contain errors, omissions, or become outdated. **Always verify critical information** against official Microsoft documentation and current threat intelligence.

### MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Mapping Context
The ATT&CK¬Æ mappings represent **potential associations** between events and adversary techniques. An event occurring does **NOT** definitively mean the mapped technique was used maliciously. **Context is absolutely critical** - these mappings are intended as investigation starting points, not definitive indicators of compromise.

### No Guarantees
This tool comes with no warranties or guarantees. Use at your own discretion and risk.
