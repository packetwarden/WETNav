 * Mapping from Windows Event IDs to MITRE ATT&CK Technique IDs.
 * Sources:
 * - techniques.json (MITRE ATT&CK Data)
 * - windows_events.json (Event ID descriptions)
 * - categories.ts (Categorization guide)
 *
 * Note: Mappings are based on the *potential* for an event to be related to a technique.
 * Not all instances of an event indicate malicious activity. Context is crucial.
 * This mapping focuses on Windows Security Log events. Sysmon events have separate mappings.

===========================================================================
 IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Event-to-ATT&CK Mapping Guidance
===========================================================================
- This mapping suggests POTENTIAL relevance between Windows Event IDs
  and MITRE ATT&CKÂ® techniques based on general security knowledge
  and the event's typical function or abuse potential.
- CONTEXT IS CRITICAL: Accurate mapping REQUIRES analyzing the full
  details (fields, values) within the actual event log entry.
- NOT DEFINITIVE: This is a manually curated guide for investigation
  and awareness. It is NOT exhaustive and should NOT be used as the
  sole basis for alerting, due to the high potential for benign
  activity generating these events.
- Verification Recommended: Always correlate with other data sources
  and perform expert security analysis.
